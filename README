GENFSTAB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simplified POSIX sh implementation of the Arch Linux tool[1] with the same name.
This implementation (with the exception of a single function) is pure shell,
the only dependency is 'readlink' which can be found in most base utility
implementations.

Pseudo-filesystem identification is better on this implementation for complex
environments. Other than this, syntax and output is identical. If you are
using a simple PC, you will not notice any difference.
